# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- Complete Python implementation of GitHub MCP Server
- Successful MCP server connection and tool operations
- FastMCP integration with GitHub API
- Error handling and validation
- Docker containerization
- PyGithub integration with object-oriented GitHub API interactions
- Centralized GitHub client management
- Robust pagination handling
- Proper parameter handling for PyGithub methods

### Architecture Implementation
- Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006):
  - Configuration system in `config/` package
  - Decorator-based tool registration in `tools/` package
  - Tools organized by domain (issues, repositories, etc.)
  - Selective enabling/disabling of tool groups
  - Factory pattern in server.py with `create_server()`

- Schema Reorganization (ADR-003):
  - Dedicated `schemas` directory with domain-specific files
  - Schemas organized by domain (base, repositories, issues, etc.)
  - Improved maintainability and discoverability

- Schema Validation (ADR-004):
  - Field validators to prevent empty strings in critical fields
  - Validation for owner, repo, path, title, body, and label fields
  - Enhanced error messages for validation failures
  - Aligned with PyGithub expectations

- Common Module Reorganization (ADR-005):
  - Domain-specific directories for converters
  - Dedicated modules for error handling, client management, and utilities
  - Backward compatibility through re-exports
  - Standardized on PyGithub for API interactions

- Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007):
  - Operations layer accepts Pydantic models directly
  - No parameter unpacking between layers
  - Validation logic lives in Pydantic models
  - Consistent error handling across layers

## Current Status
Core implementation is operational with the new modular architecture. All GitHub issue and repository operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging.

We've successfully implemented:
- ADR-002: Real API Testing Strategy
- ADR-003: Schema Reorganization
- ADR-004: Enhanced Schema Validation
- ADR-005: Common Module Reorganization 
- ADR-006: Modular Tool Architecture
- ADR-007: Pydantic-First Architecture

All unit and integration tests now pass with no warnings. The TestGitHubClient warning has been resolved and test coverage for the datetime conversion module has been significantly improved. We've gained a better understanding of the separation between parsing (convert_iso_string_to_datetime) and normalization (ensure_utc_datetime) functions.

We've made improvements to the testing infrastructure, particularly with the analyze_coverage.py script to better handle test collection and execution. The script now uses a simpler, more reliable approach to test execution by running all tests at once instead of the previous module-by-module approach. However, there appear to be some lingering issues with test execution within the script that need further investigation.

### Priorities
1. Implement additional tool groups (repositories, pull_requests, etc.)
2. Enhance testing coverage for the new architecture
3. Create documentation for adding new tool groups
4. Optimize performance for tool loading
5. Continue improving test coverage for low-coverage modules
6. Prepare for PyPI publication

## Known Issues
1. Some modules still have low test coverage
2. Documentation could be more comprehensive
3. Performance could be optimized
4. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
5. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

## Next Actions
1. Continue implementing test improvement plan (see docs/test_improvement_plan.md):
   - ✅ Fixed TestGitHubClient warning in unit tests
   - ✅ Improved coverage for converters/common/datetime.py (from 54% to 95%+)
   - ✅ Created test infrastructure for systematic coverage improvements
   - ✅ Enhanced test coverage workflow with clear documentation
   - Improve coverage for tools/repositories/tools.py (currently 63%)
   - Enhance repositories.py coverage (currently 77%)
2. Use coverage analyzer to prioritize test development
3. Generate tests for highest-priority modules using the test generator
4. Implement more integration tests with real API testing
5. Add performance optimizations
6. Enhance documentation
7. Prepare for PyPI publication
