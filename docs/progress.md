## Current Status
Core implementation is operational with the new modular architecture. We've successfully implemented ADR-006, creating a flexible, configurable tool system that can selectively enable or disable tool groups. This greatly improves the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.

Recent improvements include:

1. Implemented Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006):
   - Created a configuration system in `config/` package
   - Implemented a decorator-based tool registration system in `tools/` package
   - Migrated issue tools from server.py to `tools/issues/tools.py`
   - Refactored server.py to use a factory pattern with `create_server()`
   - Added support for selectively enabling/disabling tool groups
   - Enhanced code organization with clear separation of concerns
   - Improved maintainability with logical tool grouping
   - Created foundation for easy expansion with additional tool groups

2. Added Configuration Flexibility:
   - Support for both file-based and environment variable configuration
   - Clear precedence rules (env vars override file settings)
   - Sensible defaults for all configuration options
   - Created example configuration file
   - Added documentation for configuration options
   - Enabled selective tool group enablement
   - Simplified deployment across different environments

3. Created Testing Strategy for Modular Architecture:
   - Added unit tests for configuration system without mocks
   - Added unit tests for tool registration system
   - Created integration tests for issue tools following ADR-002
   - Established patterns for testing new tool groups
   - Created testing documentation

4. Updated Core System Components:
   - Fixed imports and exports to match new architecture
   - Enhanced error handling in tool modules
   - Improved logging throughout the system
   - Updated server initialization to use factory pattern
   - Created consistent patterns for future expansion
   - Ensured backward compatibility for existing functionality

Schema models have been reorganized into domain-specific files and enhanced with validation rules to prevent empty strings in critical fields. This improves maintainability, discoverability, and error handling. The reorganization establishes a foundation for schema-first development approach for new features.

We've significantly improved test coverage for schema validation, particularly for the issues.py file, which now has 100% coverage. We've added comprehensive tests for datetime validation with various timezone formats, including negative timezone offsets (-05:00, -0500) which were previously untested. This has addressed specific branch coverage gaps in the validate_since method for both ListIssuesParams and ListIssueCommentsParams, as well as the validate_title method in UpdateIssueParams with None value.

We've addressed specific test failures in schema validation by adding strict=True to field definitions in CreateIssueParams and GetIssueParams, and fixing validation for empty content lists in ToolResponse. These changes ensure proper type checking and prevent automatic type coercion, which was causing test failures.

We've updated our testing strategy (ADR 002) to prioritize real API testing over mock-based testing. This decision was made after experiencing significant challenges with mock-based testing, including complex mock implementations, brittle test fixtures, and difficulty maintaining mock parity with API changes. The updated ADR provides a detailed implementation plan for transitioning to real API tests and guidance for future development.

Test suite continues to improve with enhanced rate limit error handling and real API testing approach. Recent improvements include proper handling for edge cases, implementation of retry mechanisms, and comprehensive test coverage with real API interactions. All GitHub issue operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging. Each tool follows established patterns for kwargs handling and object conversion.

Focus now on improving test coverage for low-coverage modules (client, rate_limit, errors, operations) and continuing implementation of the real API testing strategy.

### Priorities
1. Implement additional tool groups (repositories, pull_requests, etc.)
2. Enhance testing coverage for the new architecture
3. Create documentation for adding new tool groups
4. Optimize performance for tool loading
5. Fix remaining integration test failures
6. Continue improving test coverage for low-coverage modules

8. Add additional configuration options for advanced use cases
9. Create architectural diagrams for better understanding
10. Add monitoring and logging enhancements

## Known Issues
1. ~~Several integration tests are still failing (see test_failure_resolution_plan.md)~~ Fixed issues in test_issue_lifecycle and test_list_issues
2. Some modules still have low test coverage
3. Tests making assumptions about repository state
4. Documentation could be more comprehensive
5. Performance could be optimized
6. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
7. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

   - test_handle_github_exception_rate_limit
   - test_list_issue_comments_since
   - test_list_issues_pagination
   - test_list_issues_labels_filter
   - test_list_issues_since
2. Improve coverage for client/client.py (currently 34%)
3. Improve coverage for operations/issues.py (currently 74%)

5. Implement more integration tests with real API testing
6. Add performance optimizations
7. Enhance documentation

## Dependencies
- Git repository at github.com/AstroMined/pygithub-mcp-server
- Python 3.10+
- MCP Python SDK
- Pydantic
- PyGithub
- pytest
- UV package manager

## Notes
- Real API testing provides higher confidence than mock-based testing
- Mocks often fail to accurately represent API behavior
- Time spent debugging mock behavior could be better spent on real tests
- Focus on behavior and outcomes rather than implementation details
- Implement thorough cleanup to prevent test pollution
- Use test tagging to allow skipping integration tests when appropriate
- Maintain a dedicated test repository for integration tests
- Tag all test-created resources for easy identification and cleanup
- Use unique identifiers for test resources to prevent conflicts
- Separate unit tests and integration tests into distinct directories
- Build a robust unit test suite first before implementing integration tests
