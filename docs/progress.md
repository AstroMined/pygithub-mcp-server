## Current Status
Core implementation completed and operational with synchronous operations. Package renamed and published to GitHub repository. Server successfully connects and processes MCP tool requests. Test suite has been significantly improved with all GitHubClient tests now passing and mock object implementations fixed. Recent improvements include proper attribute access patterns in mock classes, consistent property decorator usage, and resolved fixture dependencies. All GitHub issue operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging. Each tool follows established patterns for kwargs handling and object conversion. Focus now on improving test coverage further and preparing for PyPI publication.

### Priorities
1. Prepare for PyPI publication
2. Improve test coverage further
3. Expand documentation with examples
4. Add performance optimizations
5. Integrate advanced features
6. Improve error handling
7. Add monitoring and logging

## Known Issues
1. Test coverage could be improved further
2. Some mock objects may not accurately reflect API responses
3. Documentation could be more comprehensive
4. Performance could be optimized
5. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
6. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

## Next Actions
1. Improve test coverage
2. Refine mock objects
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Implement advanced features
5. Enhance documentation

## Dependencies
