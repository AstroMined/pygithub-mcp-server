## Current Status
Core implementation completed and operational with synchronous operations. Package renamed and published to GitHub repository. Server successfully connects and processes MCP tool requests.

We've updated our testing strategy (ADR 002) to prioritize real API testing over mock-based testing. This decision was made after experiencing significant challenges with mock-based testing, including 24/25 failing tests, complex mock implementations, brittle test fixtures, and difficulty maintaining mock parity with API changes. The updated ADR provides a detailed implementation plan for transitioning to real API tests and guidance for future development.

Test suite continues to improve with enhanced rate limit error handling and mock fixtures. Recent improvements include proper RateLimitExceededException handling, improved error message formatting, and comprehensive rate limit test coverage. All GitHub issue operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging. Each tool follows established patterns for kwargs handling and object conversion.

Focus now on implementing the real API testing strategy and preparing for PyPI publication.
