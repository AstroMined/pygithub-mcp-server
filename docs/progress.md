## Current Status
Core implementation is operational with synchronous operations. We've made significant improvements to test coverage and quality by implementing the ADR-002 approach of using real API testing instead of mocks.

Recent improvements include:
1. Fixed the failing test in `test_responses.py` by properly handling `None` values with `json.dumps(None)` to produce "null" instead of "None".
2. Added the missing `convert_issue_list` function to the issues converter module.
3. Created comprehensive tests for converters using realistic data structures that match PyGithub's API.
4. Implemented integration tests for the client module and error handlers using the real GitHub API.
5. Removed legacy mock-based tests in favor of the ADR-002 approach.

Schema models have been reorganized into domain-specific files and enhanced with validation rules to prevent empty strings in critical fields. This improves maintainability, discoverability, and error handling. The reorganization establishes a foundation for schema-first development approach for new features.

We've significantly improved test coverage for schema validation, particularly for the issues.py file, which now has 100% coverage. We've added comprehensive tests for datetime validation with various timezone formats, including negative timezone offsets (-05:00, -0500) which were previously untested. This has addressed specific branch coverage gaps in the validate_since method for both ListIssuesParams and ListIssueCommentsParams, as well as the validate_title method in UpdateIssueParams with None value.

We've addressed specific test failures in schema validation by adding strict=True to field definitions in CreateIssueParams and GetIssueParams, and fixing validation for empty content lists in ToolResponse. These changes ensure proper type checking and prevent automatic type coercion, which was causing test failures.

We've updated our testing strategy (ADR 002) to prioritize real API testing over mock-based testing. This decision was made after experiencing significant challenges with mock-based testing, including complex mock implementations, brittle test fixtures, and difficulty maintaining mock parity with API changes. The updated ADR provides a detailed implementation plan for transitioning to real API tests and guidance for future development.

Test suite continues to improve with enhanced rate limit error handling and real API testing approach. Recent improvements include proper handling for edge cases, implementation of retry mechanisms, and comprehensive test coverage with real API interactions. All GitHub issue operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging. Each tool follows established patterns for kwargs handling and object conversion.

Focus now on improving test coverage for low-coverage modules (client, rate_limit, errors, operations) and continuing implementation of the real API testing strategy.

### Priorities
1. Continue improving test coverage for low-coverage modules (client, rate_limit, errors, operations)
2. Implement more integration tests following ADR-002
3. Expand schema validation to all models
4. Prepare for PyPI publication
5. Expand documentation with examples

2. Improve coverage for client/rate_limit.py (currently 18%)
3. Improve coverage for errors/formatters.py (currently 11%)
4. Improve coverage for errors/handlers.py (currently 6%)
5. Improve coverage for operations/issues.py (currently 8%)
6. Expand schema validation to all models
7. Implement more integration tests with real API testing

- Python 3.10+
- MCP Python SDK
- Pydantic
- PyGithub
- pytest
- UV package manager

## Notes
- Real API testing provides higher confidence than mock-based testing
- Mocks often fail to accurately represent API behavior
- Time spent debugging mock behavior could be better spent on real tests
- Focus on behavior and outcomes rather than implementation details
- Implement thorough cleanup to prevent test pollution
- Use test tagging to allow skipping integration tests when appropriate
- Maintain a dedicated test repository for integration tests
- Tag all test-created resources for easy identification and cleanup
- Use unique identifiers for test resources to prevent conflicts
- Separate unit tests and integration tests into distinct directories
- Build a robust unit test suite first before implementing integration tests
