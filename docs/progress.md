## Current Status
Core implementation completed and operational with synchronous operations. Package renamed and published to GitHub repository. Server successfully connects and processes MCP tool requests. Initial testing shows improved reliability with synchronous approach. The create_issue tool demonstrates our improved parameter handling patterns, using kwargs for optional parameters and proper object conversion. Focus now on implementing remaining issue operations following these established patterns, along with PyPI publication, testing, optimization, and feature expansion.

### Priorities
1. Prepare for PyPI publication
2. Implement comprehensive test suite
3. Expand documentation with examples
4. Add performance optimizations
5. Integrate advanced features
6. Improve error handling
7. Add monitoring and logging

## Known Issues
1. Test coverage needs improvement
2. Documentation could be more comprehensive
3. Some edge cases need better handling
4. Performance could be optimized
5. Rate limiting needs fine-tuning
6. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
7. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

## Next Actions
1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Create comprehensive test suite
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Implement advanced features

## Dependencies
- Git repository at github.com/AstroMined/pygithub-mcp-server
- Python 3.10+

## Notes
- Package renamed for PyPI compatibility
- Build isolation works fine without flags
- Following test-driven development approach
- Implementing features incrementally
- Maintaining documentation alongside code
- Focusing on code quality and maintainability
- Local development setup proven successful
- MCP tools functioning as expected
