## Current Status
Core implementation completed and operational with synchronous operations. Package renamed and published to GitHub repository. Server successfully connects and processes MCP tool requests.

Schema models have been reorganized into domain-specific files and enhanced with validation rules to prevent empty strings in critical fields. This improves maintainability, discoverability, and error handling. The reorganization establishes a foundation for schema-first development approach for new features.

We've significantly improved test coverage for schema validation, particularly for the issues.py file, which now has 100% coverage. We've added comprehensive tests for datetime validation with various timezone formats, including negative timezone offsets (-05:00, -0500) which were previously untested. This has addressed specific branch coverage gaps in the validate_since method for both ListIssuesParams and ListIssueCommentsParams, as well as the validate_title method in UpdateIssueParams with None value.

We've addressed specific test failures in schema validation by adding strict=True to field definitions in CreateIssueParams and GetIssueParams, and fixing validation for empty content lists in ToolResponse. These changes ensure proper type checking and prevent automatic type coercion, which was causing test failures.

We've fixed issues in the test suite by correcting indentation problems in tests/schemas/test_issues.py and removing a redundant test file (tests/schemas/test_issues_complete.py) that was causing confusion and test failures. The redundant file was incomplete and had a truncated test method that was causing a NameError during test execution.

We've updated our testing strategy (ADR 002) to prioritize real API testing over mock-based testing. This decision was made after experiencing significant challenges with mock-based testing, including 24/25 failing tests, complex mock implementations, brittle test fixtures, and difficulty maintaining mock parity with API changes. The updated ADR provides a detailed implementation plan for transitioning to real API tests and guidance for future development.

Test suite continues to improve with enhanced rate limit error handling and mock fixtures. Recent improvements include proper RateLimitExceededException handling, improved error message formatting, and comprehensive rate limit test coverage. All GitHub issue operations have been implemented as MCP tools with proper parameter handling, error management, and logging. Each tool follows established patterns for kwargs handling and object conversion.

Focus now on improving test coverage for remaining schema files (base.py at 73%, responses.py at 78%) and implementing the real API testing strategy.

2. Expand schema validation to all models
3. Implement real API testing strategy
4. Prepare for PyPI publication
5. Improve remaining module coverage
6. Expand documentation with examples
7. Add performance optimizations

2. Documentation could be more comprehensive
3. Performance could be optimized
4. Need to document synchronous operation benefits
5. Need to update API examples for synchronous usage

## Next Actions

2. Improve test coverage for responses.py (currently 78%)
3. Expand schema validation to all models
4. Implement real API testing strategy
5. Replace issue lifecycle tests with real API tests
6. Implement thorough cleanup mechanisms
7. Document patterns for real API testing
8. Continue test coverage improvements
9. Add performance optimizations
