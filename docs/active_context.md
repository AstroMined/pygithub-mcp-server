  - add_issue_comment: Add a comment to an issue
  - list_issue_comments: List comments on an issue
  - update_issue_comment: Update an issue comment
  - delete_issue_comment: Delete an issue comment
  - add_issue_labels: Add labels to an issue
  - remove_issue_label: Remove a label from an issue

- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
- Followed established patterns for tool registration and response formatting
- Renamed package from github-mcp-server to pygithub-mcp-server
- Created GitHub repository at github.com/AstroMined/pygithub-mcp-server
- Added LICENSE.md (MIT) and .gitignore

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions

1. PyGithub Integration
   - Using singleton pattern for client management
   - Maintaining FastMCP interface stability
   - Aligning schemas with PyGithub objects
   - Leveraging PyGithub's built-in features

2. Schema Evolution
   - Moving from REST API schema to object model
   - Adding PyGithub-specific fields
   - Implementing proper type validation
   - Maintaining backward compatibility

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Starting with list_issues proof of concept
   - Phased approach to feature implementation
   - Focus on stability and reliability
   - Comprehensive documentation updates

## Current Considerations

### Current Challenges

1. Schema Migration
   - Mapping between PyGithub objects and our schemas
   - Handling new PyGithub-specific fields
   - Maintaining type safety
   - Ensuring backward compatibility

2. Testing Strategy
   - Mocking PyGithub objects
   - Testing pagination
   - Error condition coverage
   - Integration test approach

3. Feature Expansion
   - Identifying useful PyGithub features
   - Planning feature implementation order
   - Maintaining consistent patterns
   - Documentation coverage

### Implementation Lessons
1. Error Handling
   - Standardized error handling improves maintainability
   - Clear error messages help with debugging
   - Resource type detection provides better context
   - Validation errors should be actionable
   - Consistent patterns across operations
   - Security implications must be considered

2. Documentation
   - Comprehensive guides improve usability
   - Security considerations must be documented
   - Examples help clarify usage patterns
   - Tool reference must be detailed
   - Error handling deserves special attention

3. Project Structure
   - Singleton pattern benefits for client management
   - Clear separation of concerns in operations
   - Importance of schema documentation
   - Value of phased implementation
   - Match library requirements for parameter handling
   - Build isolation works fine without flags
   - Package naming important for PyPI publication

2. PyGithub Integration
   - Follow library examples for parameter patterns
   - Handle assertions properly
   - Use simpler parameter passing when possible
   - Validate parameters before API calls
   - Build kwargs dynamically for optional parameters
   - Only include non-None values in method calls
   - Convert primitive types to PyGithub objects
   - Handle object conversion errors explicitly

2. Environment Setup
   - PyGithub dependency management
   - Token-based authentication remains unchanged
   - Testing infrastructure needs
   - Documentation importance

3. Server Operation
   - FastMCP interface stability
   - Error handling improvements
   - Rate limiting benefits
   - Object model advantages
