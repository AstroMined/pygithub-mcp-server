# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
We're focused on implementing comprehensive test coverage improvements following ADR-002 principles while continuing to refine the modular tool architecture (ADR-006) and completing the Pydantic-First Architecture implementation (ADR-007).

Key areas of current work:
1. Improving test coverage for high and medium priority modules
2. Implementing real API testing across all components (ADR-002)
3. Refining unit testing techniques without using mocks
4. Creating reusable test fixtures and patterns for integration testing
5. Maintaining the modular tool architecture (ADR-006)
6. Establishing patterns for testing future tool group implementations
7. Aligning test suite with Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007)

## Next Steps

1. Fix Coverage Analysis Tool Issues:
   - Investigate and fix the inaccurate coverage report (currently showing 28% instead of expected ~90%)
   - Review coverage configuration in pyproject.toml and the tool
   - Add debug output to identify where the issue is occurring
   - Ensure all modules are properly included in coverage calculation
   - Verify the coverage data parsing logic in parser.py

2. Execute Enhanced Test Improvement Plan:
   - Phase 1: Complete dataclass framework for PyGithub objects
   - Phase 2: Improve tools/repositories/tools.py coverage (63% → 80%+)
   - Phase 2: Enhance repositories.py operations coverage (77% → 90%+)
   - Phase 3: Standardize remaining integration tests with fixtures
   - Phase 3: Create test generation scripts for rapid test creation

3. Expand Modular Architecture:
   - Implement additional tool groups (pull_requests, users, etc.)
   - Create consistent patterns for new tool groups
   - Develop configuration templates for different scenarios
   - Enhance modularity with pluggable architecture

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize tool loading based on configuration
   - Implement lazy loading for tool groups
   - Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Improve memory usage for large number of tools

5. Documentation:
   - Create detailed guide for adding new tool groups
   - Document configuration best practices
   - Add examples for common configuration scenarios
   - Create architectural diagrams for better understanding

## Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Coverage Analysis Architecture
- Organize code into well-defined responsibilities (runner, parser, reporting)
- Use dataclasses for structured coverage data representation
- Implement a Python package structure for proper imports
- Provide direct module execution capability through __main__.py
- Remove external entry points in favor of module-based execution

### 2. Modular Architecture Approach
- Use decorator-based registration for tools
- Organize tools by domain (issues, repositories, etc.)
- Support selective enabling/disabling of tool groups
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### 3. Configuration System Design
- Support both file-based and environment variable configuration
- Establish clear precedence rules for configuration sources
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings
- Document all configuration options clearly

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Follow ADR-002's real API testing approach
- Test configuration components without mocks
- Create integration tests for tool functionality
- Ensure proper cleanup of test resources

### 5. Code Organization
- Group related tools in dedicated modules
- Keep tool implementations separate from registration
- Maintain clear separation between configuration and execution
- Establish consistent patterns across all modules

## Implementation Lessons

### Python Package Best Practices
- Proper package structure improves import experience and usability
- Direct module execution via __main__.py is cleaner than external scripts
- Package exports in __init__.py make the API clear and discoverable
- Separation of concerns with dedicated modules enhances maintainability
- Good object model design simplifies data flow and transformation

### Coverage Analysis Challenges
- Coverage calculation is sensitive to test execution approach
- Existing .coverage data files can lead to inaccurate results
- Direct coverage.py invocation may produce different results than pytest-cov
- Coverage configuration in pyproject.toml needs careful alignment with analysis tools
- Multiple coverage outputs (HTML, JSON, terminal) require careful configuration to avoid conflicts

### Datetime Handling and Testing Lessons
- Function roles should be clearly differentiated and documented:
  - convert_iso_string_to_datetime: Parses ISO strings but doesn't enforce timezone awareness
  - ensure_utc_datetime: Handles timezone normalization and adding UTC timezone to naive datetimes
- Tests should match actual function behavior rather than assumed behavior
- Pydantic schema validation is the proper layer for enforcing data requirements (not utility functions)
- Utility functions should be flexible to support various internal use cases
- Test failures often indicate misunderstood function behavior rather than bugs

### Real API Testing (ADR-002)
- Real API testing provides higher confidence than mocked tests
- Test fixtures with proper cleanup prevent test pollution
- Tests should focus on behaviors rather than implementation details
- Dataclasses can replace mock objects for cleaner, type-safe tests
- Context managers simplify test environment setup and teardown
- Tests should respect class hierarchies and implementation details

### Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006)
- Decorator-based registration simplifies tool management
- Dynamic import provides flexibility but requires careful error handling
- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Configuration-driven loading enables customization without code changes
- Factory pattern in server.py centralizes server creation and configuration

### Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007)
- Passing Pydantic models directly to operations improves type safety
- Built-in Pydantic validation eliminates need for custom validation code
- Validation happens automatically at model instantiation time
- Reducing parameter unpacking/repacking improves maintainability
- Clear ownership of validation in Pydantic models reduces duplication
- No need for validation decorator since Pydantic handles it naturally

### PyGithub Integration Lessons
- PyGithub's `get_issues()` doesn't directly accept per_page parameter
- Need to handle pagination through PaginatedList objects instead
- API behavior differs from documentation in some cases
- Tests need to be resilient to real-world repository state
