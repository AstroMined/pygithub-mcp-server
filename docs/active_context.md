# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing comprehensive test coverage improvements following ADR-002 principles while continuing to refine the modular tool architecture (ADR-006). We've shifted from a monolithic server design to a modular, configurable architecture that supports selective enabling/disabling of tool groups, and now we're ensuring robust test coverage across all components.

Our current focus is on:
1. Improving test coverage for high and medium priority modules identified in testing strategy
2. Implementing the ADR-002 approach of real API testing across all components
3. Refining unit testing techniques without using mocks
4. Creating reusable test fixtures and patterns for integration testing
5. Maintaining and organizing the modular tool architecture as defined in ADR-006
6. Establishing patterns for efficient testing of future tool group implementations

We've made several improvements to test coverage, fixed bugs, and enhanced error handling. Key enhancements include:

1. Fixed the handling of `None` values in the `create_tool_response` function by properly using `json.dumps(None)` to produce "null" rather than the string "None".

2. Implemented the `convert_issue_list` function in the issues converter, enhancing our ability to handle collections of issues.

3. Created comprehensive tests for converters using realistic data structures instead of mocks:
   - Implemented realistic classes in tests that match PyGithub's API
   - Created test fixtures with proper data structures for Issue, User, Label, etc.
   - Tested all edge cases without relying on mocks

4. Created integration tests following the ADR-002 approach:
   - Added client module tests using real GitHub API
   - Implemented rate limit handling tests
   - Added error handlers tests with real error conditions
   
5. Extended test coverage for high-priority modules:
   - Added comprehensive error case tests for tools/issues/tools.py
   - Created server initialization and configuration tests
   - Improved rate limit handling test coverage
   - Added parameter validation tests for operations/issues.py
   - Developed test patterns for main module without using mocks

6. Refined our approach to unit testing without mocks:
   - Used dataclasses to create test objects instead of MagicMock
   - Leveraged pytest fixtures for test data preparation
   - Implemented dependency injection for easier testing
   - Created context managers for controlled test environments
   - Focused on testing behavior rather than implementation details

## Recent Changes

   - JSON configuration files offer more complex configuration options
   - Clear precedence rules prevent confusion
   - Sensible defaults reduce configuration burden
   - Validation prevents common misconfigurations

3. Testing Strategies:
   - Real API testing provides higher confidence than mocked tests
   - Test fixtures with proper cleanup prevent test pollution
   - Configuration can be tested without mocks

   - Dataclasses can replace mock objects for cleaner, type-safe tests
   - Context managers simplify test environment setup and teardown
   - Fixture scope affects performance and isolation (session vs function)
   - Tests should focus on behaviors rather than implementation details
   - Standard library tools can often replace complex mocking frameworks

4. Code Organization:
   - Logical grouping improves code navigation
   - Consistent patterns simplify maintenance
