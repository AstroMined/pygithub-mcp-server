# Active Context

## Current Focus
Restructuring and optimizing the GitHub MCP Server following official best practices, with focus on proper project structure and reliable operation.

## Recent Changes
- Restructured project to follow recommended uvx/MCP SDK layout
- Moved to src-based layout with proper package structure
- Successfully rebuilt and tested with new structure
- Updated MCP server configuration to use venv Python interpreter
- Verified working MCP tool operations in new structure

## Next Steps

1. Port Additional Operations
   - Evaluate and port remaining operations from archive
   - Maintain consistent structure and patterns
   - Update documentation for new operations

2. Testing Implementation
   - Set up pytest infrastructure
   - Create test fixtures and mocks
   - Implement unit tests for operations
   - Add integration tests for API calls

3. Documentation Improvements
   - Add more usage examples
   - Create API reference documentation
   - Document common patterns and best practices
   - Add troubleshooting guide

4. Feature Enhancements
   - Add support for GraphQL API
   - Implement webhook handling
   - Add real-time updates support
   - Expand search capabilities

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions

1. Project Structure
   - src/ layout following uvx best practices
   - Proper package organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular operation organization

2. Development Environment
   - UV for dependency management
   - Virtual environment for isolation
   - Direct venv Python usage in MCP config
   - Local development setup proven successful

3. Core Architecture
   - FastMCP server implementation
   - Synchronous operations for reliability
   - Pydantic for schema validation
   - Clean separation of operations

## Current Considerations

### Current Challenges

1. Project Organization
   - Maintaining clean structure
   - Proper dependency management
   - Consistent patterns across modules
   - Clear documentation

2. Testing Coverage
   - Comprehensive test suite needed
   - API mocking strategy
   - Integration test infrastructure
   - Error condition coverage

3. Feature Expansion
   - GraphQL API integration
   - Webhook support
   - Real-time updates
   - Advanced search features

### Implementation Lessons
1. Project Structure
   - src/ layout provides better organization
   - Proper package structure improves maintainability
   - Clear separation of operations is beneficial

2. Environment Setup
   - UV virtual environment management works well
   - Direct venv Python usage in MCP config is more reliable
   - Dependencies properly isolated in venv
   - Build process needs --no-build-isolation flag

3. Server Operation
   - MCP tools functioning as expected
   - Error handling working effectively
   - GitHub API integration stable
   - Proper venv configuration essential
