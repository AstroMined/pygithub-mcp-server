# Active Context

## Current Focus
Package renamed to pygithub-mcp-server and published to GitHub. Continuing to implement comprehensive PyGithub integration with focus on leveraging the library's object-oriented interface for improved reliability and maintainability.

## Recent Changes
- Renamed package from github-mcp-server to pygithub-mcp-server
- Created GitHub repository at github.com/AstroMined/pygithub-mcp-server
- Added LICENSE.md (MIT) and .gitignore
- Confirmed build works without --no-build-isolation flag
- Implemented PyGithub integration for issues module as proof of concept
- Created GitHubClient singleton for centralized PyGithub management
- Added comprehensive object conversion utilities
- Implemented proper pagination and error handling
- Updated documentation with PyGithub patterns
- Fixed list_issues parameter handling to match PyGithub requirements
- Improved error handling for PyGithub assertions

## Next Steps

1. PyPI Publication
   - Verify package name availability
   - Prepare for PyPI release
   - Document installation process
   - Update badges in README.md

2. Schema Alignment
   - Update Pydantic models to match PyGithub objects
   - Document field mappings and relationships
   - Implement conversion utilities
   - Add validation for PyGithub-specific constraints

2. Client Implementation
   - Create singleton GitHubClient class
   - Implement PyGithub instance management
   - Add object conversion utilities
   - Handle pagination and rate limiting

3. Operation Refactoring
   - Convert list_issues as proof of concept
   - Document new patterns and approaches
   - Plan additional operation implementations
   - Maintain FastMCP interface stability

4. Testing Implementation
   - Set up pytest infrastructure
   - Create test fixtures and mocks
   - Implement unit tests for operations
   - Add integration tests for API calls

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions

1. PyGithub Integration
   - Using singleton pattern for client management
   - Maintaining FastMCP interface stability
   - Aligning schemas with PyGithub objects
   - Leveraging PyGithub's built-in features

2. Schema Evolution
   - Moving from REST API schema to object model
   - Adding PyGithub-specific fields
   - Implementing proper type validation
   - Maintaining backward compatibility

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Starting with list_issues proof of concept
   - Phased approach to feature implementation
   - Focus on stability and reliability
   - Comprehensive documentation updates

## Current Considerations

### Current Challenges

1. Schema Migration
   - Mapping between PyGithub objects and our schemas
   - Handling new PyGithub-specific fields
   - Maintaining type safety
   - Ensuring backward compatibility

2. Testing Strategy
   - Mocking PyGithub objects
   - Testing pagination
   - Error condition coverage
   - Integration test approach

3. Feature Expansion
   - Identifying useful PyGithub features
   - Planning feature implementation order
   - Maintaining consistent patterns
   - Documentation coverage

### Implementation Lessons
1. Project Structure
   - Singleton pattern benefits for client management
   - Clear separation of concerns in operations
   - Importance of schema documentation
   - Value of phased implementation
   - Match library requirements for parameter handling
   - Build isolation works fine without flags
   - Package naming important for PyPI publication

2. PyGithub Integration
   - Follow library examples for parameter patterns
   - Handle assertions properly
   - Use simpler parameter passing when possible
   - Validate parameters before API calls

2. Environment Setup
   - PyGithub dependency management
   - Token-based authentication remains unchanged
   - Testing infrastructure needs
   - Documentation importance

3. Server Operation
   - FastMCP interface stability
   - Error handling improvements
   - Rate limiting benefits
   - Object model advantages
