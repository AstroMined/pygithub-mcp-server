# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
We're focused on implementing comprehensive test coverage improvements following ADR-002 principles while continuing to refine the modular tool architecture (ADR-006) and completing the Pydantic-First Architecture implementation (ADR-007).

Key areas of current work:
1. Improving test coverage for high and medium priority modules
2. Implementing real API testing across all components (ADR-002)
3. Refining unit testing techniques without using mocks
4. Creating reusable test fixtures and patterns for integration testing
5. Maintaining the modular tool architecture (ADR-006)
6. Establishing patterns for testing future tool group implementations
7. Aligning test suite with Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007)

## Recent Changes

### Pagination Implementation
- Created unified pagination in `converters/common/pagination.py`
- Implemented safe handling of GitHub's PaginatedList objects
- Added comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Fixed naming conflicts and improved error handling
- Made list operations consistently use the pagination utility

### Fixed Tests for Large Repositories
- Resolved tests hanging when accessing repositories with many issues
- Added pagination parameters to all list_issues calls in tests
- Updated testing documentation with pagination best practices
- Ensured tests run efficiently regardless of repository size

### Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007)
- Refactored issue operations to accept Pydantic models directly
- Updated tools to pass models directly to operations
- Simplified error handling across all layers
- Reduced code duplication by eliminating parameter unpacking
- Enhanced type safety throughout the issue operations and tools

### GitHub Issue Tools Fixes
- Fixed parameter validation for required fields
- Improved empty string handling in update_issue
- Enhanced pagination in list operations
- Updated error handling to maintain descriptive messages
- Modified test assertions for user-friendly error formats

### Integration Test Improvements
- Enhanced tool decorator to convert dictionaries to Pydantic models
- Fixed field name inconsistencies ("number" vs "issue_number")
- Added timezone designation to ISO datetime strings
- Made Pydantic an explicit dependency

### Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006)
- Created configuration system in dedicated `config/` package
- Implemented decorator-based tool registration system
- Migrated issue tools to `tools/issues/tools.py`
- Refactored server.py to use factory pattern
- Added support for enabling/disabling tool groups via configuration
- Created comprehensive testing strategy for modular architecture

## Next Steps

1. Expand Modular Architecture:
   - Implement additional tool groups (repositories, pull_requests, etc.)
   - Create consistent patterns for new tool groups
   - Develop configuration templates for different scenarios
   - Enhance modularity with pluggable architecture

2. Testing Strategy Enhancement:
   - Expand test coverage for configuration system
   - Add real API tests for all tool modules
   - Develop efficient testing patterns for tool groups
   - Implement automated config validation tests

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize tool loading based on configuration
   - Implement lazy loading for tool groups
   - Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Improve memory usage for large number of tools

4. Documentation:
   - Create detailed guide for adding new tool groups
   - Document configuration best practices
   - Add examples for common configuration scenarios
   - Create architectural diagrams for better understanding

## Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture Approach
- Use decorator-based registration for tools
- Organize tools by domain (issues, repositories, etc.)
- Support selective enabling/disabling of tool groups
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### 2. Configuration System Design
- Support both file-based and environment variable configuration
- Establish clear precedence rules for configuration sources
- Provide sensible defaults for all settings
- Document all configuration options clearly

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Follow ADR-002's real API testing approach
- Test configuration components without mocks
- Create integration tests for tool functionality
- Ensure proper cleanup of test resources

### 4. Code Organization
- Group related tools in dedicated modules
- Keep tool implementations separate from registration
- Maintain clear separation between configuration and execution
- Establish consistent patterns across all modules

## Implementation Lessons

### Real API Testing (ADR-002)
- Real API testing provides higher confidence than mocked tests
- Test fixtures with proper cleanup prevent test pollution
- Tests should focus on behaviors rather than implementation details
- Dataclasses can replace mock objects for cleaner, type-safe tests
- Context managers simplify test environment setup and teardown

### Modular Tool Architecture (ADR-006)
- Decorator-based registration simplifies tool management
- Dynamic import provides flexibility but requires careful error handling
- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Configuration-driven loading enables customization without code changes
- Factory pattern in server.py centralizes server creation and configuration

### Pydantic-First Architecture (ADR-007)
- Passing Pydantic models directly to operations improves type safety
- Built-in Pydantic validation eliminates need for custom validation code
- Validation happens automatically at model instantiation time
- Reducing parameter unpacking/repacking improves maintainability
- Clear ownership of validation in Pydantic models reduces duplication
- No need for validation decorator since Pydantic handles it naturally

### PyGithub Integration Lessons
- PyGithub's `get_issues()` doesn't directly accept per_page parameter
- Need to handle pagination through PaginatedList objects instead
- API behavior differs from documentation in some cases
- Tests need to be resilient to real-world repository state
