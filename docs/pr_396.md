## Description

This PR fixes the structure of tool responses in the GitHub server to conform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification. Specifically, it refactors the `list_issues`, `update_issue`, `add_issue_comment`, and `get_issue` tools to ensure their responses adhere to the correct MCP content structure as defined in the [MCP schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/schema.json#L80).

## Server Details

- Server: `github`
- Changes to: `tools`

## Motivation and Context

Previously, the GitHub server's tool responses were not structured according to the MCP specification. This caused issues with clients that rely on strict adherence to the protocol. By ensuring the responses are correctly formatted with a `content` array containing objects of type `text`, this PR resolves those compatibility problems and ensures seamless interaction with MCP-compliant clients.

## How Has This Been Tested?

This change has been thoroughly tested using two methods:

1. **Spring AI MCP Client:** A comprehensive test suite was implemented using a Spring AI MCP client to interact with the modified GitHub server. The following scenarios were tested:
   - Listing the first 10 issues from the `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repository.
   - Retrieving the details of a specific issue (issue number 10) from the `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repository.
   - Creating a new issue in the `apappascs/test` repository.
   - Updating an existing issue (issue number 1) in the `apappascs/test` repository, modifying the title and state.
   - Adding a comment to an existing issue (issue number 1) in the `apappascs/test` repository.

   All tests passed successfully, demonstrating that the modified tools now return responses in the correct MCP format, which are then properly interpreted by the Spring AI client.

2. **MCP Inspector:** The changes were also validated using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to ensure compliance with the MCP specification.

## Breaking Changes

No, this change does not introduce any breaking changes. It only modifies the internal structure of tool responses to align with the MCP specification, and it does not affect the functionality or usage of the tools.

## Types of changes

- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
- [ ] Documentation update

## Checklist

- [x] I have read the [MCP Protocol Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- [x] My changes follow MCP security best practices
- [x] I have updated the server's README accordingly (No need - changes are internal to tool responses.)
- [x] I have tested this with an LLM client
- [x] My code follows the repository's style guidelines
- [x] New and existing tests pass locally
- [x] I have added appropriate error handling
- [x] I have documented all environment variables and configuration options (No new environment variables or configuration options were added.)

## Additional context

The core change involved updating the return statements in the affected tools from:

```js
return { toolResult: result };
```

To:

```js
return {
  content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }],
};
```

This ensures that the responses are correctly structured as an array of content objects, each with a `type` and `text` property, as required by the MCP specification.
